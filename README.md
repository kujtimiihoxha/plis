# Plis

Plis is an application used to create and run cli tools, plis is created to make it easy for you to create tools for
automating tasks that you do repeatedly , creating code, and other tools for making your workflow faster. Examples of
such tools are `angular-cli`, `gulp`, `artisan(laravel)`.

# Why I created Plis

I created plis to be faster when working on my projects, I did some frontend development with angular 2 and
before `angular-cli` came out there was a lot of boilerplate code that I needed to write again and again this is one of
the reasons I started developing plis so next time I need to create a tool like `angular-cli` I can do it quicker.
Another place I intend to use plis is with go-kit, I think there is a lot of boilerplate code I could automate and since
I plan to use go-kit in some of my future projects I will most certainly create a tool for that.

So in a nutshell I created plis to make my development life easier.
